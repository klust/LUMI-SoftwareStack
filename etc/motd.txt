 * | IMPORTANT: Check the post-maintenance updates on               |
 * | https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/update-202409/            |
   |                                                                |
*  | NOTE: The default version of both the Cray PE and LUMI stack   |
   | is now 24.03 and this is also the only version of the Cray PE  |
  *| officially supported on the current system. We recommend       |
   | moving to 24.03 when possible. Base libraries for 24.03 and    |
  *| 23.12 are already on the system and much user-installable      |
   | software for 24.03 is already available also.                  |
*  |                                                                |
   | The system update originally planned for late August 2025 has  |
   | been postponed to a yet-to-be-decided moment. This also        |
 * | implies that for now, newer ROCm versions than 6.2 cannot be   |
   | used reliably on LUMI, nor do programming environments that    |
  *| rely on those versions and that we can provide in containers,  |
   | fully work.                                                    |
   |                                                                |
   | The advice remains to rely on the most recent programming      |
*  | environment where possible and to consider using containers    |
*  | on ROCm 6.2 for AI applications, as this offers the best       |
   | guarantee of a relatively smooth upgrade to an ultimately      |
   | updated system.                                                |
 * |                                                                |
*  | You can use the lumi-workspaces command (without loading an    |
   | additional module) to check your quota and allocations on      |
  *| LUMI. Also check `module help lumi-tools` for more info.       | 
   |                                                                |
   | Note that LUMI users are responsible for verifying software    |
*  | licenses for the packages they use and must also obey to all   |
   | export restriction laws which includes several and ever        |
   | changing export restriction laws.                              |
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
 * |   and other tools.                                             |
*  | - spack: If you are an experienced Spack user and know how it  |
   |   works. Spack is offered as-is. We do not do development or   |
  *|   bug fixing in Spack but do offer a configuration compatible  |
** |   with the Cray PE.                                            |
